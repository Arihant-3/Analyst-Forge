## Reflection

### **What was your biggest improvement across the 30 days?**  
Over the past 30 days, I learned how to read and interpret data more confidently. While I sometimes looked up or cheated for code or insights: repeating and practicing helped me understand what the code was doing. I also learned how to plot data effectively, make graphs more visually appealing, and explore different data types, including time series. This hands-on repetition helped build a stronger foundation in both analysis and visualization.

### **How did your thinking shift from Day 1 to Day 30?**  
On Day 1, I was unsure where to start. By Day 30, I found myself exploring data more quickly and spotting insights faster. I did notice that many insights felt repetitive — possibly because of demo data — but that in itself taught me an important lesson: in the real world, data might not always be exciting, but asking the right questions is key. Most importantly, I learned how to learn, what to look for, and how to think analytically, even if the insights aren’t always obvious.

### **What would you include in your analyst portfolio to show off your growth?**  
I would include the insights I generated, the visualizations I created, and the way I presented data clearly.
