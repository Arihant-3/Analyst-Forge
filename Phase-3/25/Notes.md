### Answer

1.    |Price_Offered | Total_users | Total_Revenue | Conversion_Rate |     ARPU   |
      | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
      |        5     |     876     |       820     |   18.721461     |  0.936073  |
      |       10     |    1221     |      1740     |   14.250614     |  1.425061  |
      |       15     |     903     |       780     |    5.758583     |  0.863787  |


2.  - Price 10 is giving best revenue
    - Price 5 is giving best conversion rates
    - Offering more 10 and 5 price to customers

3.  - |Price_Offered | Total_users | Total_Revenue | Conversion_Rate |     ARPU   |
      | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
      |        7     |     1000    |       1183    |   16.9          |  1.183     |

    - 7 improves ARPU compared to 5, but does not outperform ₹10.

- **Is highest revenue always the best choice?**  
NO, it depends upon business goals, margins, and especially long-term strategy.

- **What role does pricing psychology play in real life?**  
If a product is priced too high, customers feel it's risky or unaffordable.  
If it's too low, they question its quality or reliability.  
But when pricing sits at a mid-level sweet spot, it feels fair, trustworthy, and worth trying — even if the buyer isn’t fully sure yet.  
This “worth the gamble” zone is where perceived value meets emotional comfort. 

- **What if lifetime value (LTV) > first purchase? Would your pricing change?**  
If Lifetime Value (LTV) exceeds first-purchase revenue, pricing should shift from maximizing upfront gains to optimizing long-term customer acquisition and retention. Lower prices that build trust and loyalty can unlock much higher total revenue in future.
