- **Can segmentation reduce marketing waste?**  
Yes, because we know where to put focus and budget:
1. Identify which users are worth retaining, upselling, or reactivating.
2. Focus marketing budget on high-LTV (Lifetime Value) users.
3. Avoid over-targeting disengaged or low-potential segments.

- **What risks come from bad segmentation?**  
1. Waste of resources: Targeting the wrong audience increases CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).
2. Waste of time: Marketing and product efforts go in the wrong direction.
3. Loyalty and trust issues: Sending irrelevant messages frustrates engaged users

- **If you had user feedback text, how would you combine it with this segmentation?**  
Using NLP by tokenization, word embedding, model training to gain insights and works further on improvements
