By increasing server size and providing more offers to the consumers

- **How do you explain dips not caused by trend or seasonality?**  
Such dips are often caused by external shocks or anomalies, not captured by the model. Examples include:
    1. Downtime or server outages
    2. Holiday weekends or long breaks where traffic naturally drops
    3. Technical issues, like bugs preventing access or slow load times
    4. News cycle shifts or user attention diverted to external events (e.g., festivals, elections, major sports finals)
