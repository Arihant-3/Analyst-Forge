---

- **Do some cities consistently underperform?**  
I can't say that because the data doesn't provide the date/month/year of order.

- **Could geography or infrastructure explain delays?**  
Yes, of course â€” delivery delays are often influenced by geographical and infrastructural factors. In cities with high traffic congestion and a dense volume of vehicles like bikes and cars, delays are expected. Additionally, in many parts of India, narrow and cluttered roads further contribute to slower last-mile delivery.

- **Would you adjust resource allocation?**  
Yes we can adjust resource allocation by maintaining the stocks in different region of a state so that the delivery time would be less and the delivery guy also have to travel less and we can cost cut in the fuel or transportation.
