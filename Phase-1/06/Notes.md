1. Done

2. Strongest positive correlations is between maths and science
strongest negative correlations is between Extra_Curricular_Score and maths

3. + Maths score is the one single predictor as it is highest correlated to all.  
   + Extra activities interfere academics as in maths(maximum correlation), science and attendence(minimum correlation)

4. Removing one feature doesn’t change the raw relationships between other features — but it can hide important indirect correlations.

- **Why might Math hurt Extra_Curricular_Score?**  
As math requires practise. But if student involes in extra_curricular as an enjoyment(that's what most data say about) and it usually takes time to heal from the fatigue or from mental usage. So the student focussing on academics have to take time out from extra_curricular to practise for maths.

- **Should schools encourage all-roundedness or focused excellence?**  
I think all-roundedness, because in short term may be excellence is good looking but in long term these extra_curricular activity plays a great role in shaping the overall attitude, your communication, presentation skill, etc. And will help you to explore more outside of academics and books.
