# 📊 RFM Analysis Explained

RFM stands for **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary** — a popular customer segmentation technique used in marketing and business analytics.

## 🔍 What Is RFM?

RFM helps you understand customer behavior by answering three key questions:

- **Recency (R)**: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- **Frequency (F)**: How often do they purchase?
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money do they spend?

---

## 🧮 RFM Components

### 🔹 `R_Score` (Recency Score)

- Tells how recent a customer's last purchase was.
- Customers who purchased recently get a **higher score (5)**.
- Those who haven't bought in a long time get a **lower score (1)**.

### 🔹 `F_Score` (Frequency Score)

- Reflects how often a customer has purchased.
- More frequent shoppers get a **higher score (5)**.
- Infrequent buyers get a **lower score (1)**.

### 🔹 `M_Score` (Monetary Score)

- Measures how much money the customer has spent.
- High spenders get a **higher score (5)**.
- Low spenders get a **lower score (1)**.

Each score is typically calculated using **quantiles** (dividing customers into 5 equal groups).

---

## 🏷️ `RFM_Segment`

- Combines all three scores into a single label.
- Example:  
  `R=5`, `F=1`, `M=3` → **Segment: `513`**

You can use this to easily group and analyze customer behavior patterns.

---

## ➕ `RFM_Total`

- Sum of all three scores: `R_Score + F_Score + M_Score`
- Used to rank customers overall.
- Max value = 15 (best), Min value = 3 (worst)

---

## 🎯 Uses of RFM Analysis

- **Identify loyal customers** (high F & M, low R)
- **Re-engage inactive users** (low R score)
- **Spot big spenders** (high M score)
- **Target marketing campaigns** to specific segments
- **Personalize offers** based on customer behavior
- **Optimize retention strategies**

> ✨ Tip: You can also assign human-readable tags to segments like `"Champions"`, `"At Risk"`, `"Loyal Customers"`, etc. based on RFM patterns.
